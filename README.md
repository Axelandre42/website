## Project goal

This project aims for an better whitelist management of the semipublic server run by Axelandre42.

### Why publishing it?

As the words of Axelandre42:

> As a proof of trust I provide the source code of the website.
> I want that any user can read it and find I'm not saving any third-party password or so.
> I published the source code to make security audits easier.
>
> On the second hand, _public_ versionning allows public contributing.
> That way the project can get a faster development process.
